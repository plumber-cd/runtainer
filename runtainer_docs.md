### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string    global config file (default is $HOME/.runtainer.yaml)
      --debug            Enables info and debug logs to file
  -d, --dir string       Use different folder to make a CWD in the container (default is the host CWD)
      --dry-run          Dry Run mode will not execute the container, only print to StdOut a pod spec it would have run.
  -i, --interactive      Disable to not to attach to the container.
                         	By default we wait till pod becomes Running and then - attaching to it.
                         	If container expected to run a script in non-interactive mode and exit,
                         	- the tool might try to attach to the container that is already finished and fail.
                         	Disable interactive mode in this case - then it will not attempt to attach
                         	and instead will just stream logs until containe becomes either Succeeded or Failed.
                         	This automatically disables --stdin and --tty. (default true)
      --log              Enables info logs to file
  -p, --port strings     Mapping for ports, i.e. --port 8080:8080
  -q, --quiet            Enable quiet mode.
                         	By default runtainer never prints to StdOut,
                         	reserving that channel exclusively to the container.
                         	But it does print messages to StdErr.
                         	Enabling quiet mode will redirect all messages to the info logger.
                         	If --log mode was not enabled - these messages will be discarded.
  -s, --stdin            Redirect host StdIn to the container (default true)
  -t, --tty              Enable TTY, disable if piping something to stdin (default true)
  -v, --volume strings   Mapping for volumes, i.e. --volume /data:/data
```
